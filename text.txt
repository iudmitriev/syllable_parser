If any have an ear
Saith holy John, then let him hear.
He that into Captivity
Leads others, shall a Captive be.
Who with the sword doth others kill,
A sword shall his blood likewise spill.
Here is the patience of the Saints,
And the true faith, which never faints.
Were not thy word (dear Lord!) my light,
How would I run to endless night,
And persecuting thee and thine,
Enact for Saints my self and mine.
But now enlighten’d thus by thee,
I dare not think such villany;
Nor for a temporal self-end
Successful wickedness commend.
For in this bright, instructing verse
Thy Saints are not the Conquerers;
But patient, meek, and overcome
Like thee, when set at naught and dumb.
Armies thou hast in Heaven, which fight,
And follow thee all cloath’d in white,
But here on earth (though thou hast need)
Thou wouldst no legions, but wouldst bleed.
The sword wherewith thou dost command
Is in thy mouth, not in thy hand,
And all thy Saints do overcome
By thy blood, and their Martyrdom.
But seeing Soldiers long ago
Did spit on thee, and smote thee too;
Crown’d thee with thorns, and bow’d the knee,
But in contempt, as still we see,
Tle marvel not at ought they do,
Because they us’d my Savior so;
Since of my Lord they had their will,
The servant must not take it ill.

Dear Jesus give me patience here,
And faith to see my Crown as near
And almost reach’d, because ’tis sure
If I hold fast and slight the Lure.
Give me humility and peace,
Contented thoughts, innoxious ease,
A sweet, revengeless, quiet minde,
And to my greatest haters kinde.
Give me, my God! a heart as milde
And plain, asw hen Icw ahsi al de;
That when thy Throne is set, and all
Sites Conquerors before it fall,
I may be found (preserv’d by thee)
Amongst that chosen company,
Who by no blood (here) overcame
But the blood of the blessed Lamb.
